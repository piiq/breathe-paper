"""Models.

This module includes utilities and helper functions from the repository that contains
the PyTorch code for the following paper:
[Rethinking CNN Models for Audio Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11154)

In the original project the classes and methods were located in different files and
folders so simple copying and pasting code from this section into the original
project might not work.
